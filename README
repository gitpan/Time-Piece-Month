NAME
    Time::Piece::Month - a month of Time::Piece objects

SYNOPSIS
      use Time::Piece::Month;

            my $month = Time::Piece::Month->new(Time::Piece $tp);
            my $month = Time::Piece::Month->new("2002-01-03");

            my Time::Piece::Month $prev = $month->prev_month;
            my Time::Piece::Month $next = $month->next_month;

            my @dates = $month->dates;
            my @dates = $month->wraparound_dates;

DESCRIPTION
    This is an extension to Time::Piece::Range that represents a complete
    calendar month.

CONSTRUCTOR
            my $month = Time::Piece::Month->new(Time::Piece $tp);

            my $month = Time::Piece::Month->new("2002-01-03");

    A Month object can be instantiated from either a Time::Piece object, or
    a Y-m-d format string.

METHODS
    As well as the inherited Time::Piece::Range methods, we also include:

prev_month / next_month
            my Time::Piece::Month $prev = $month->prev_month;
            my Time::Piece::Month $next = $month->next_month;

    The next and previous months.

  wraparound_dates
    This returns a list of Time::Piece objects representing each day in the
    month, but also including the days on either side that ensure that the
    full list runs from a Sunday to a Saturday. This is useful for
    displaying calendars.
